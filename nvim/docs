        --
        -- surrounding is identified by a single character as both "input" (in delete and replace start, find, and highlight) and "output" (in add and replace end):
        -- 'f' - function call (string of alphanumeric symbols or '_' or '.' followed by balanced '()'). in "input" finds function call, in "output" prompts user to enter function name.
        -- 't' - tag. in "input" finds tag with same identifier, in "output" prompts user to enter tag name.
        -- all symbols in brackets '()', '[]', '{}', '<>". in "input' represents balanced brackets (open - with whitespace pad, close - without), in "output" - left and right parts of brackets.
        -- '?' - interactive. prompts user to enter left and right parts.
        -- all other single character identifiers (supported by getcharstr()) represent surrounding with identical left and right parts.
    


    auto-cmp
      <tab> -> opens the menue or selects the next option
      <S-tab> -> prev option
      <CR>/<C-y> -> injects elected code 
      <C-j>/<C-k> -> scrolls the window 
      <tab> -> if you are inside a snippet, jumps to next placeholder,
               ex, from one function argument to another
      <S-tab> -> prev argument

      <C-e> -> abort

      <Tab>	
        Completion menu is open (1 option) -> Autoconfirms the choice immediately.
        Completion menu is open (>1 option)	-> Moves to the next item in the list.
        Inside a snippet (like a for loop) ->	Jumps to the next placeholder/variable.
        On an empty line or whitespace -> Inserts a physical tab/spaces (smart-indent).
        Anywhere else -> Manually triggers the completion menu.

      <S-Tab>	
        Completion menu is open	-> Moves to the previous item in the list.
        Inside a snippet -> Jumps back to the previous placeholder.
        At the start of an indented line -> Dedents (deletes a full level of indentation).

      When the menu is open, you have multiple ways to navigate. 
        Navigate List: Use <C-j> (Next) and <C-k> (Previous). You can also use <C-n>/<C-p> or the arrow keys.
        Confirm Selection: Press <CR> (Enter) or <C-y>.
          Note: This config uses "Smart Confirm." If the code you're inserting already matches what's ahead of your cursor, 
          it won't duplicate the text.

        Scroll Documentation: Use <C-f> (forward) and <C-b> (back). If a function has a long explanation or several parameters, 
        use these to read the popup window without moving your cursor.

        Close Menu: Press <C-e>. 

      Smart Backspace
        The smart_bs function is a hidden gem for backend devs.
        Interaction: When you hit <BS> (Backspace) at the beginning of a line that uses spaces for indentation, 
        it won't just delete one space. It will calculate your shiftwidth and delete the entire "tab level."
